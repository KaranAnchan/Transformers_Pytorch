# 🚀 Transformer Model from Scratch 🚀

Welcome to the Transformer Model Pytorch repository! This project showcases a custom implementation of the Transformer architecture using PyTorch. Dive into sequence-to-sequence learning with one of the most influential models in natural language processing.

## 🌟 Overview

The Transformer model, introduced by Vaswani et al. in the paper ["Attention is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), has set a new standard in NLP by eliminating the need for recurrent networks. It leverages self-attention mechanisms to achieve great performance in tasks such as translation, text generation, and more.

### 🎯 Features

- **Pure PyTorch Implementation**: Understand the internals of the Transformer model by examining every detail of its implementation.
- **Modular Design**: Easily modify and extend components like multi-head self-attention, positional encoding, and more.
- **Comprehensive Training and Evaluation Scripts**: Train and test the model on your custom datasets with minimal setup.
- **Visualization Tools**: Visualize attention mechanisms and training progress.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.8.0 or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
- Altair (for advanced visualizations)

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transformer-from-scratch.git
   cd transformer-from-scratch
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### Training the Model

Train the Transformer model on your dataset with a single command:

```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/your/dataset --epochs 10 --batch_size 32 --learning_rate 0.0001
```

### Evaluating the Model

Evaluate the trained model's performance:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/saved/model --data_path /path/to/your/dataset
```

### Example Usage

Here's how to use the `InputEmbeddings` class in the model:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from input_embeddings import InputEmbeddings

# Example parameters
d_model = 512
vocab_size = 10000

# Initialize the input embeddings
input_embeddings = InputEmbeddings(d_model, vocab_size)

# Example input sequence of token indices (batch size = 1, sequence length = 4)
input_tokens = torch.tensor([[1, 5, 3, 7]])

# Get the embeddings for the input tokens
embedded_tokens = input_embeddings(input_tokens)
print(embedded_tokens)
print(embedded_tokens.shape)
```

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

Our Transformer model includes the following key components:

1. **Input Embeddings**: Converts token indices to dense vectors.
2. **Positional Encoding**: Adds positional information to embeddings, helping the model understand the order of tokens.
3. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence.
4. **Feed-Forward Neural Network**: Introduces non-linearity and complexity to the model.
5. **Encoder and Decoder Layers**: Stacks of attention and feed-forward layers for complex representations.
6. **Output Linear Layer**: Maps the decoder output to the target vocabulary size.

### 📊 Visualization

To better understand the model's inner workings, use our visualization tools to inspect attention weights and training metrics.
