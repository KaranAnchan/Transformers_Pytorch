# üöÄ Transformer Model from Scratch üöÄ

Welcome to the Transformer Model Pytorch repository! This project showcases a custom implementation of the Transformer architecture using PyTorch. Dive into sequence-to-sequence learning with one of the most influential models in natural language processing.

## üåü Overview

The Transformer model, introduced by Vaswani et al. in the paper ["Attention is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), has set a new standard in NLP by eliminating the need for recurrent networks. It leverages self-attention mechanisms to achieve great performance in tasks such as translation, text generation, and more.

### üéØ Features

- **Pure PyTorch Implementation**: Understand the internals of the Transformer model by examining every detail of its implementation.
- **Modular Design**: Easily modify and extend components like multi-head self-attention, positional encoding, and more.
- **Comprehensive Training and Evaluation Scripts**: Train and test the model on your custom datasets with minimal setup.
- **Visualization Tools**: Visualize attention mechanisms and training progress.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.8.0 or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
- Altair (for advanced visualizations)

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transformer-from-scratch.git
   cd transformer-from-scratch
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Training the Model

Train the Transformer model on your dataset with a single command:

```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/your/dataset --epochs 10 --batch_size 32 --learning_rate 0.0001
```

### Evaluating the Model

Evaluate the trained model's performance:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/saved/model --data_path /path/to/your/dataset
```

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

Our Transformer model includes the following key components:

1. **Input Embeddings**: Converts token indices to dense vectors.
2. **Positional Encoding**: Adds positional information to embeddings, helping the model understand the order of tokens.
3. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence.
4. **Feed-Forward Neural Network**: Introduces non-linearity and complexity to the model.
5. **Encoder and Decoder Layers**: Stacks of attention and feed-forward layers for complex representations.
6. **Output Linear Layer**: Maps the decoder output to the target vocabulary size.

### üìä Visualization

To better understand the model's inner workings, use our visualization tools to inspect attention weights and training metrics.

#### Encoder Self-Attention

Visualize the self-attention mechanisms in the encoder layers:

```python
encoder_self_attention_maps = get_all_attention_maps(
    "encoder", layers, heads, encoder_input_tokens, encoder_input_tokens, min(20, sentence_len))
encoder_self_attention_maps.display()
```

#### Decoder Self-Attention

Visualize the self-attention mechanisms in the decoder layers:

```python
decoder_self_attention_maps = get_all_attention_maps(
    "decoder", layers, heads, decoder_input_tokens, decoder_input_tokens, min(20, sentence_len))
decoder_self_attention_maps.display()
```

#### Encoder-Decoder Attention

Visualize the attention mechanisms between the encoder and decoder layers:

```python
encoder_decoder_attention_maps = get_all_attention_maps(
    "encoder-decoder", layers, heads, encoder_input_tokens, decoder_input_tokens, min(20, sentence_len))
encoder_decoder_attention_maps.display()
```

## üìà Metrics

Evaluate the model using key metrics:

- **Character Error Rate (CER)**: CER measures the percentage of characters that are incorrectly predicted. Lower CER indicates better performance.

```math
\[ \text{CER} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Character Errors}}{\text{Total Number of Characters}} \right) \times 100 \]
```

- **Word Error Rate (WER)**: WER measures the percentage of words that are incorrectly predicted. Lower WER indicates better performance. It considers substitutions, insertions, and deletions of words.

```math
\[ \text{WER} = \left( \frac{\text{Substitutions} + \text{Insertions} + \text{Deletions}}{\text{Total Number of Words}} \right) \times 100 \]
```

- **BLEU Score**: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) Score is a metric for evaluating the quality of text that has been machine-translated from one language to another. Higher BLEU scores indicate better performance.

```math
\[ \text{BLEU} = \text{BP} \cdot \exp \left( \sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n \log p_n \right) \]

where:
- \(\text{BP}\) is the Brevity Penalty
- \(p_n\) is the precision of n-grams
- \(w_n\) is the weight for n-grams, usually \(w_n = \frac{1}{N}\)
```

These metrics provide insights into the model's performance in translating and understanding text.
